Maybe thank them for sharing their name. But since it's a placeholder, I need to make sure not to refer to them as <PERSON> literally. Hmm, perhaps they want me to use their real name in the response, but since it's replaced, I can't. Alternatively, maybe they're testing how I handle placeholders. \n\nI should respond in a way that's friendly and helpful. Maybe say something like, \"Hello, [Full Name]! How can I assist you today?\" But since their name is masked, I can't use the actual name. Wait, the user might have intended to input their real name but used <PERSON> as an example. So, perhaps I should prompt them to provide their actual name if they want a personalized response. But the user's message is \"My full name is <PERSON>\", so maybe they just want to share that information, and I should respond accordingly without needing to use the name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a data privacy practice, where the user is anonymizing their information. In that case, I should respect that and not ask for the real name. I should just proceed to offer assistance without using the placeholder. \n\nSo, the best approach is to thank them for providing their name and ask how I can assist them. That way, it's polite and doesn't focus on the placeholder. Let me draft a response like that.\n"

My task is to replace the actual phone number with the placeholder <PHONE_NUMBER>. Let me check the example they gave.\n\nIn the example, the original message is \"You can reach me at 555-123-4567\", and the response is \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\". So, the phone number was identified and replaced with the tag. \n\nI need to make sure that any phone number in the user's message is similarly redacted. The key here is to recognize different phone number formats. Common formats include:\n\n- 555-123-4567\n- (555) 123-4567\n- 555.123.4567\n- 555 123 4567\n- +1 555 123 4567\n- International numbers might have different country codes, like +44 20 1234 5678\n\nI should create a regular expression that can detect these variations. Let me think about the regex pattern. It should account for optional country codes, different separators (hyphens, spaces, parentheses, dots), and varying lengths. \n\nA possible regex pattern could be something like:\n\n(\\+?\\d{1,3}[-.\\s]?)?(\\(\\d{1,3}\\)[-.\\s]?)?\\d{1,4}[-.\\s]?\\d{1,4}[-.\\s]?\\d{1,4}\n\nBut I need to test this pattern against different phone number examples to ensure it works. Let me test a few:\n\n1. 555-123-4567: Matches\n2. (555) 123-4567: Matches\n3. 555.123.4567: Matches\n4. 555 123 4567: Matches\n5. +1 555 123 4567: Matches\n6. +44 20 1234 5678: Matches\n\nHmm, but some numbers might have extensions, like 555-123-4567 ext. 89012. Should I handle those? The example didn't include an extension, so maybe the user doesn't expect that. But if the input has an extension, should I still replace the entire number including the extension? The original instruction just says to replace the phone number, so perhaps only the main number part. However, without specific guidance on extensions, maybe it's safer to handle the main number and leave the extension as is. But since the user's example didn't include that, maybe the current regex is sufficient.\n\nAnother edge case: numbers without separators, like 5551234567. The regex should still catch that if the pattern allows for optional separators. Let me check. The current regex has optional [-.\\s]? between groups, so 5551234567 would be split into groups of 1-4 digits. For example, 555-123-4567 is 3-3-4, but 5551234567 would be 3-3-4 without separators. The regex should still match that as \\d{1,4} three times. So yes, it should catch that.\n\nWhat about international numbers with varying lengths? For example, some countries have different number lengths. The regex allows for 1-4 digits in each segment, which might not cover all cases, but it's a general approach. Since the user's example uses a US number, maybe focusing on that is okay, but the instruction is to replace any phone number.

            "thinking": "Okay, the user provided a message that includes a phone number. My task is to replace the actual phone number with the placeholder <PHONE_NUMBER>. Let me check the example they gave.\n\nIn the example, the original message is \"You can reach me at 555-123-4567\", and the response is \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\". So, the phone number was identified and replaced with the tag. \n\nI need to make sure that any phone number in the user's message is similarly redacted. The key here is to recognize different phone number formats. Common formats include:\n\n- 555-123-4567\n- (555) 123-4567\n- 555.123.4567\n- 555 123 4567\n- +1 555 123 4567\n- International numbers might have different country codes, like +44 20 1234 5678\n\nI should create a regular expression that can detect these variations. Let me think about the regex pattern. It should account for optional country codes, different separators (hyphens, spaces, parentheses, dots), and varying lengths. \n\nA possible regex pattern could be something like:\n\n(\\+?\\d{1,3}[-.\\s]?)?(\\(\\d{1,3}\\)[-.\\s]?)?\\d{1,4}[-.\\s]?\\d{1,4}[-.\\s]?\\d{1,4}\n\nBut I need to test this pattern against different phone number examples to ensure it works. Let me test a few:\n\n1. 555-123-4567: Matches\n2. (555) 123-4567: Matches\n3. 555.123.4567: Matches\n4. 555 123 4567: Matches\n5. +1 555 123 4567: Matches\n6. +44 20 1234 5678: Matches\n\nHmm, but some numbers might have extensions, like 555-123-4567 ext. 89012. Should I handle those? The example didn't include an extension, so maybe the user doesn't expect that. But if the input has an extension, should I still replace the entire number including the extension? The original instruction just says to replace the phone number, so perhaps only the main number part. However, without specific guidance on extensions, maybe it's safer to handle the main number and leave the extension as is. But since the user's example didn't include that, maybe the current regex is sufficient.\n\nAnother edge case: numbers without separators, like 5551234567. The regex should still catch that if the pattern allows for optional separators. Let me check. The current regex has optional [-.\\s]? between groups, so 5551234567 would be split into groups of 1-4 digits. For example, 555-123-4567 is 3-3-4, but 5551234567 would be 3-3-4 without separators. The regex should still match that as \\d{1,4} three times. So yes, it should catch that.\n\nWhat about international numbers with varying lengths? For example, some countries have different number lengths. The regex allows for 1-4 digits in each segment, which might not cover all cases, but it's a general approach. Since the user's example uses a US number, maybe focusing on that is okay, but the instruction is to replace any phone number. However, creating a regex that perfectly matches all international numbers is complex. For the purpose of this task, using a general pattern that covers most common formats is acceptable.\n\nSo, applying this regex to the user's input. The user's message is \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\". Wait, in the user's input, they actually wrote \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\", but that's the example. Wait, no, the user's actual input is the first line: \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\". Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within <answer>.\"\n\nWait, no, the user's initial message is \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\", but that's the example they provided. Wait, no, the user's actual input is the first line: \"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\". Wait, no, perhaps the user is showing an example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's message is:\n\n\"You can reach me at <PHONE_NUMBER>\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put"

Start with the most recommended methods first, like using dedicated secrets managers, then move to environment variables, encryption, access control, etc. Also, provide examples for each method to make it practical. Make sure to warn against common pitfalls like hardcoding or committing to version control. Conclude with a summary of best practices to reinforce the key points.\n"
